  Create seven Markdown (.md) chapter files covering deployment, integration, and real-world humanoid systems.
response_text: |
  Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 5 - Deployment, Integration, and Real-World Humanoids with all required artifacts:

  1. plan.md - Complete implementation plan with technical context and project structure
  2. research.md - Research findings covering sim-to-real transfer, system integration, safety protocols, and testing frameworks
  3. data-model.md - Core entities and state models for the module
  4. quickstart.md - Navigation guide for the module
  5. contracts/deployment-api.yaml - API contract for deployment operations
  6. Updated agent context with new technology stack information

  The plan covers 7 chapters from simulation-to-reality concepts through deployment and maintenance operations, with proper integration into the existing Docusaurus site structure.
outcome: |
  Successfully completed Phase 1 of planning for Module 5 with all required artifacts created and constitution compliance verified. The module is ready for the task breakdown phase.
evaluation: |
  The implementation plan is comprehensive, technically accurate, and aligned with the educational objectives. All required documentation artifacts have been created with proper technical context and integration considerations.
