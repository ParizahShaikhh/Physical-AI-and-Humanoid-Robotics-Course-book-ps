# Prompt History Record: Create Module 7 Specification

## Original Prompt
```
/sp.specify

Module: Module 7 – Capstone, Evaluation, and Professional Practice

Audience:
Students who have completed all technical modules and are ready to consolidate learning into a final, portfolio-ready outcome.

Focus:
Synthesize all prior modules into a cohesive capstone project, emphasizing system design, evaluation, documentation, and real-world readiness.

Primary Outcomes:
- Integrate ROS 2, simulation, AI perception, and VLA into one system
- Architect and explain an end-to-end humanoid solution
- Evaluate system performance and limitations
- Communicate technical work clearly and professionally

Structure (7 Chapters, Docusaurus):

1. Capstone Overview and Objectives
2. System Architecture Review
3. End-to-End Humanoid Pipeline
4. Evaluation Metrics and Validation
5. Failure Modes and System Limitations
6. Documentation, Demos, and Reproducibility
7. From Capstone to Real-World Applications

Constraints:
- Format: Markdown (.md), Docusaurus-compatible
- Integration and reflection focused
- No
```
