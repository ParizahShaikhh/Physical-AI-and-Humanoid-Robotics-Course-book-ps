# Prompt History Record: Create Module 6 Plan

## Original Prompt
```

Add Module 6 to the Docusaurus site with a dedicated documentation section and sidebar entry.
Create seven Markdown (.md) chapter files covering advanced topics and future directions in Physical AI.
```

## Response Summary
Successfully created comprehensive implementation plan for Module 6 with the following components:

1. **Implementation Plan** (plan.md):
   - Technical context for Docusaurus documentation system
   - Constitution check verifying compliance with all principles
   - Project structure for documentation and integration

2. **Research Document** (research.md):
   - Content structure and approach decisions
   - Technical content depth analysis
   - Integration with existing course structure
   - Research on advanced topics in Physical AI

3. **Data Model** (data-model.md):
   - Entity definitions for Physical AI System, Human-Robot Collaboration Model, Continuous Learning System, and Governance Framework
   - Validation rules and state models

4. **Quickstart Guide** (quickstart.md):
   - Overview and module structure
   - Prerequisites and getting started
   - Key concepts and success metrics

5. **Agent Context Update**:
   - Updated CLAUDE.md with new technology information from the plan

## Files Created/Modified
- specs/006-advanced-topics-opt/plan.md: Complete implementation plan
- specs/006-advanced-topics-opt/research.md: Research document with decisions and rationale
- specs/006-advanced-topics-opt/data-model.md: Data model for the module concepts
- specs/006-advanced-topics-opt/quickstart.md: Quickstart guide for the module
- specs/006-advanced-topics-opt/contracts: Empty directory to satisfy structure requirements
- CLAUDE.md: Updated with new technology information

## Validation
- All constitutional principles verified and satisfied
- Technical context appropriate for Docusaurus documentation system
- Project structure consistent with previous modules
- Research addresses all advanced topic areas
- Plan ready for task generation phase
