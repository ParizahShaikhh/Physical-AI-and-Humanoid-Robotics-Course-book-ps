## Prompt

--title "RAG-Agent-Tasks-Generation" --stage "tasks"

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive tasks.md file for RAG Agent implementation with 53 tasks organized across 7 phases, including setup, foundational, core implementation, interface, advanced features, testing, and polish phases.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created with 53 tasks organized by user stories for independent implementation and testing
- ✅ Tests: Task structure supports both implementation and testing phases
- ✅ Files: tasks.md created with proper structure and checklist format
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for implementation phase to execute the tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks organized by user stories to enable parallel development and independent testing

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all components working correctly with comprehensive task breakdown
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - tasks document complete and validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin implementation by executing tasks in Phase 1 (Setup)
