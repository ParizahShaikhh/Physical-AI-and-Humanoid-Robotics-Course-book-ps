# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Course. This module introduces you to ROS 2 as the core middleware for humanoid robot control, enabling communication between AI agents (digital brain) and robotic actuators/sensors (physical body).

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Explain ROS 2 architecture and communication primitives
- Build and run ROS 2 nodes using Python (rclpy)
- Connect AI logic to robot controllers via ROS 2
- Read, modify, and reason about humanoid URDF models

## Prerequisites

- Basic Python knowledge
- Fundamental understanding of AI concepts
- Interest in robotics and physical AI
