# Module 7: Capstone, Evaluation, and Professional Practice

## Overview

Welcome to Module 7 - the capstone module of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. This module synthesizes all previous learning into a cohesive capstone project that emphasizes system design, evaluation, documentation, and real-world readiness.

## Module Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Integrate ROS 2, simulation, AI perception, and VLA into one cohesive system
- Architect and explain an end-to-end humanoid solution
- Evaluate system performance and identify limitations
- Communicate technical work clearly and professionally
- Create comprehensive documentation, demos, and reproducible work

## Prerequisites

## Capstone Project

The centerpiece of this module is a comprehensive capstone project where you will integrate all components from previous modules into a unified humanoid robotics system. You will document your design, evaluate its performance, and present your work professionally.

## Learning Outcomes

Upon completion of this module, you will be able to:

- Design and implement integrated humanoid robotics systems
- Evaluate system performance using quantitative metrics
- Document complex technical systems professionally
- Present technical work to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Apply professional practices to real-world robotics projects
