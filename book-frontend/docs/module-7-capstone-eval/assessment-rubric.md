# Assessment Rubric and Success Criteria

## Overview

This document provides detailed assessment rubrics and success criteria for evaluating capstone projects in the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics course. The assessment framework ensures comprehensive evaluation of technical integration, professional practices, and real-world application readiness.

## Assessment Framework

### Overall Assessment Structure

The capstone project assessment is organized into five main categories:

1. **Technical Integration** (30%) - Integration of components from all modules
2. **System Performance** (25%) - Quantitative performance metrics
3. **Professional Practices** (20%) - Documentation, presentation, reproducibility
4. **Evaluation and Analysis** (15%) - System evaluation and limitation analysis
5. **Real-World Application** (10%) - Practical application and deployment considerations
