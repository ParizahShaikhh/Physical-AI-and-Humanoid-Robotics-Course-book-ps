# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Course. This module focuses on digital twins for humanoid robot simulation using Gazebo and Unity. You'll learn how to use simulation environments for safe, repeatable testing of physics, sensors, and interactions in Physical AI development.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of digital twins in robotics
- Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- Build interactive environments in Unity
- Understand and configure simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation concepts is helpful but not required

## Chapters

This module is organized into 7 chapters:

1. [Digital Twins in Physical AI](./chapter-1-digital-twins) - Introduction to digital twins and their role in robotics
2. [Gazebo Architecture and Physics Simulation](./chapter-2-gazebo-architecture) - Understanding Gazebo architecture and physics simulation principles
3. [Simulating Gravity, Collisions, and Contacts](./chapter-3-physics-simulation) - Simulating physical interactions in Gazebo
4. [Robot and World Integration with ROS 2](./chapter-4-ros2-integration) - Connecting simulation environments with ROS 2
5. [Unity for High-Fidelity Human–Robot Interaction](./chapter-5-unity-interaction) - Building interactive environments in Unity
6. [Simulated Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs](./chapter-6-simulated-sensors) - Configuring and using simulated sensors
7. [Preparing Simulations for AI Training and Testing](./chapter-7-ai-training) - Using simulations for AI development

## Getting Started

Begin with the first chapter to understand the fundamentals of digital twins in robotics, then progress through each chapter sequentially to build your knowledge of simulation-driven Physical AI development.
