# Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Terminology Reference

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Vision-Language-Action (VLA) module.

## Core Concepts

- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: A paradigm that integrates visual perception, natural language processing, and physical action execution in robotic systems
- **Speech-to-Text Processing**: Converting spoken natural language into text format for further processing
- **Language Understanding**: Interpreting natural language commands to extract actionable tasks and object references
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking down complex commands into executable subtasks with dependencies and execution order
- **Cognitive Planning**: Using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate high-level strategies for complex robot behaviors
- **Vision-Guided Action**: Using visual perception to guide robot actions and interact with objects in the environment
- **ROS 2 Orchestration**: Coordinating perception, planning, and action execution through the ROS 2 framework

## Components

- **VLA Command**: A natural language instruction that combines vision, language, and action components, representing user intent to be executed by the robot
- **Cognitive Plan**: A high-level strategy generated by LLMs for achieving complex goals, adapting to environmental changes and constraints
- **Vision Perception**: Real-time visual understanding of the environment, including object detection, recognition, and spatial relationships
- **Action Execution**: Physical robot behaviors including navigation, manipulation, and interaction with objects and environment

## Technologies

- **OpenAI Whisper**: A speech-to-text model used for converting natural language commands to text
- **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Models used for cognitive planning and language understanding
- **Computer Vision**: Techniques for object detection, recognition, and interaction
- **ROS 2**: Robot Operating System framework for action orchestration and coordination
