# Quickstart: Module 2 - The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview
Module 2 focuses on digital twins for humanoid robot simulation using Gazebo and Unity. This module teaches students how to use simulation environments for safe, repeatable testing of physics, sensors, and interactions in Physical AI development.

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 fundamentals)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with simulation concepts is helpful but not required

## Getting Started

### 1. Navigate to Module 2
Visit the Module 2 section in the course navigation to begin with the introduction to digital twins in Physical AI.

### 2. Progress Through Chapters Sequentially
The module is designed to be completed in order:
1. Digital Twins in Physical AI
2. Gazebo Architecture and Physics Simulation
3. Simulating Gravity, Collisions, and Contacts
4. Robot and World Integration with ROS 2
5. Unity for High-Fidelity Human–Robot Interaction
6. Simulated Sensors: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, IMUs
7. Preparing Simulations for AI Training and Testing

### 3. Key Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Explain the role of digital twins in robotics
- Simulate physics, gravity, and collisions in Gazebo
- Build interactive environments in Unity
- Understand and configure simulated sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMUs)

## Resources
- Each chapter includes diagrams and visual aids
- Code examples and configuration snippets
- Links to additional resources for deeper exploration

## Next Steps
After completing Module 2, students will be prepared to move on to subsequent modules that build on simulation concepts for advanced Physical AI and humanoid robotics applications.
